In this state, this project aims to simulate a connection between a client and host where host is the system which records data from MEA and client is the system where processing and vizualizing data happen.
It assumes that there is a folder named 'Test Data' which contains some h5 files. Due to the size of our test files, I (Kowsar) did not upload them.
